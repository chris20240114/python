P: No OK.
I: OK, so you're invited to take part in a research study conducted by Professor Steve McKay and myself Anna Karen from the University of California, Santa Cruz. Before you decide whether or not to participate in the study, you should listen to this form and ask questions. If there's anything that you don't understand, so the purpose of the study is to gain a better understanding of immigrant families. The contributions and the obstacles they may face. Your participation is completely voluntary. You are free to change your mind. At any time and quit the study, you may skip any questions you don't feel comfortable enough to answer, and whatever you decide will in no way penalize you or result in the loss of benefits or services to which you are otherwise entitled. You will still receive full compensation for the study if you decide to take part in the study. Here's what will happen. You will be asked a series of questions about your experience. Of being part of an immigrant family, your experiences living in Santa Cruz County? Your perspectives on what it means to belong and to not belong, what it means to thrive, and what conditions make it easier or more difficult to create a sense of belonging. You may also be asked about related immigration issues such as pre migration and migration connections to home country educate. Nation integration into US communities parents. Or childhood mix immigration statuses within families, families and immigration related policies. So if you agree, I will conduct a 60 to 90 minute interview with you at the time and location of your convenience, we will collect some identifiable information and we hope to audio record the interview to make sure we maintain accuracy of. What you say interviews may take place over the phone or video conferencing, depending on your preferences, the potential risks of participating in this research are that you might feel uncomfortable in answering personal questions, or you may respond emotionally. If you feel that interview is causing you any emotional upset, we can refer you to mental health resources that are available to you, such as the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency. Which I can also give you the contact info for. We also understand this. This information could have a negative effect on you as a member of a mix that is family. There's a risk that your identifiable information could be accidentally disclosed. However, we take great care to minimize these risks, and the researchers are taking measures to protect you. Data, although there will be no direct benefit for you to taking part in this study, the research will benefit society, and a researcher may learn more about the experiences of mixed status family members and experiences. Of and experiences on, perspectives of immigration. If you have any questions about this research you may contact the lead researcher and sociology faculty member supervising this work. Professor Steve McKay. I can give you his contact information and if you have any questions regarding your treatment or rights as a participant, you can contact the Office of Compliance. Research Compliance Administration, which I can also give you the contact. So the information that you give in this study will be handled confidentially.

If you are asked for permission to be photographed or videoed before or after, we will provide you with a separate media release form, OK? So thank you for your participation. OK, so now. We get started, so I'm going to start by getting a sense of who you are and where you and your family. Yeah, so can you do me a favor and start by saying your age and occupation?
P: Yeah, uh, my I'm 21 years old and I am a full time. Part time student at. At Kabrio and then I am also a sales associate.
I: Awesome, can you tell me what culture or ethnicity you identify with?
P: I'm Latina Mexican.
I: Where were you born?
P: And Mexico and Guanajuato.
I: OK, UM, so if this is not too direct?
I: UM, can I ask what your citizenship status is?
P: A hacker. Update Brace and I'm an immigrant.
I: Sorry, you cut off a little bit.
I: Did you say you have DACA?
P: Yeah I am. To be.
I: No, what's up? Uhm, thank you. So we can we those? OK so thank you for that information. Uhm so we've talked about that you were born in one hot dog. Wanna walk though. Can you, are you familiar with I'm? I'm sorry, give me. A second, I don't know why.
P: Totally fine. Take your time.
I: People, I think you'll be better now. OK so yeah, we we talked about how you were born in Mexico, can you tell me a little bit about your migration story and how you? Got to the US.
P: Uhm, yeah. So I have no real kind of memory from it. Anything that I remember is kind of like, uh, it's a dream kind of thing. And it's from information that my brothers or my family has given to me throughout the years of like how it happened and how. We I reacted to it or they reacted to it so. Uhm, I was around. Around 2:00 to three years old, when my dad decided to bring us to the US. Previous to that, he had actually been working here in the US to find a home, get a stable job so he could bring us here without like bringing us. To nothing, you know. So he once he was capable able to have a stable job and a home for us, he decided to bring us over. Come from my very vague memories I remember. Being scared during the time of like us moving here because it was very had to be very careful. We I was young and I had to come over with just my siblings and I and a family friend. So it was very like I don't know what was going on. That moment but. I don't know it's it's kind of like every time I think about it, I get this like like sinking feeling in my stomach like I felt something bad was gonna happen. But I had like like. Everybody around me was like it. It's for something good. It's for your future. It's for something better. So I was dumb. I was able to crossover around the age of three with my siblings and I reunited with my dad and my mom then came over to be together with us. But during that time of like separation between my parents, it was very scary for me. I remember my brother telling me that. They were terrified because it was just gonna be us.The kids moving across the border.Uhm, when we did come over it was come to the house that we have now. So I've lived in the same place my whole life and I'm grateful for that because without the people that my parents work for, I don't think we'd have a stable home or a a stable life if if if anything. But yeah, around the age of three, I moved over. I had to cross the border. My memories are very vague and kind of blurry, but that's as much as I can remember, sorry.

I: No, yeah, thank. You and you mentioned that you crossed over with your siblings. Can you tell me a little bit like about your family makeup? Like how many siblings do you have? Yeah, the child you are like the middle or.
P: Oh yeah, uhm I have, uh, two older brothers, UM one. And when we when we moved when we decided to cross the border it was just my two brothers and I. I was the youngest at the moment and my my busy now. Like my best friend, I guess you can call her UM and then now it's a I'm the middle child still because I have a younger brother and a little sister.
I: Thank you so you mentioned that like uhm, your dad migrated first before you bringing guys over what brought him to this region of you know.
P: What was that question again, sorry.
I: Uhm, what brought your dad? To the Santa Cruz region specifically.
P: Oh OK uhm well. I don't really know. I don't think I've ever asked that question. I think it was just him chasing like an opportunity like a work opportunity. I think if I remember correctly, he said he would. He would stand outside the home. Depot and ask for work. And then sorry sorry Sir and then he would. He finally got a job opportunity because one of his friends worked at a organic farm and he stuck his head out for him and was like this man is like hard working like I've seen him every day standing out there trying to work and get like. Actual like hard work for for the money that he needed to bring his family here and they finally said yes to having my dad work in the farms. And from what I hear from his coworkers. Uhm, in like parties that they have and stuff like that. My dad is like one of the most hardworking men that they have. I think when even the the like, the bosses like the the owners of the business come to our house and like they tell the stories of like how my dad is like. Like probably like three men in one, because he's capable of doing so many things by himself. But yeah, that's how he he. He came to Santa Cruz, I think just because. He he knew family members that were living around the area. Uhm, he tried finding a job for before Home Depot. He tried finding a job with like a a friend of a friend. They didn't have any openings, so that's how he started working at Home Depot because people would say like hey like if if you want a job and right now you don't have like a permit to work. Home Depot would be your best. Best some. Like best help that you could get and from there that's how he got the job at the now place that he works.
I: Thank you for sharing that up. So I know you were pretty young when you migrated and you've mentioned it a little bit, but what did you hear about the US before migrating? Like? What did your parents tell you?
P: Uh, my whole life. I've been kind of. Like so I've been told that like opportunities are is what we have in the US like. Like when you come here. It's a place where you can be anybody. If you can dream it, you can be it. And if you have less ganas to work, you can find a job and there's there's no way you can't find a job, but you'll be able to like succeed here if you have the ganas.
I: OK, and do you think that's something like now that you've lived here for the majority of your life? Do you think that's something that's like true?
P: I think it's true to an extent. I think that yes, you anybody can make it here, but uhm, I mean. With the kind of the society that we have, it's very hard because. Like let's say that it's me as a Latina. I have less of a chance of getting a job because there's this other person who is dumb. Like I don't know, I it it's. It's I don't. Know how to explain it like it's dumb. Like there's some places that will accept me because they're not racist and they actually want to help the community and they want people who actually, you know, work because they want to work in making this society better. And there's others that are like oh, she's Latina or oh she's like not of my ethnicity, so I don't want it to work with me and then treat me less. Or give me less of an opportunity to show like what I'm actually capable of doing.
I: I see, is this an experience like do you have a specific experience or this has been the case people?
P: I think it it kind of has, yeah.
I: Do you have an example? Do you want to elaborate on that?
P: Yeah, sure, uhm. I used to work at this one, uh, it was like a parking lot. It was attached to a whole other business, but I I worked in the parking lot area and I applied to be a like the leader. Kind of. It was like a supervisor to the people working physically in the parking lot and then there was people above me. But I I applied to be like a lead. That's what they were called and. The I I was told a lot throughout the whole process of me trying to get that hire job that because I was a girl and because I was like very little and I was Latina that I wasn't gonna get the job because I didn't have the experience or anything. But in the job description. It said that you didn't need experience. All you had to all your experience was that you at least had to have worked the first position for a little bit for a couple of months, and then you'd get trained for the next position. But you don't need actual experience. And so that was kind of like my first time experiencing that kind of like, uhm? I guess in a way hate towards me and what I kind of stood for. Uhm, I mean, on top of that, not just in work but like at schools I would. I was told at a very young age. Age by another student who was actually older than. Me, I was. I think it was in like. 3rd grade and she was in fifth grade and she I didn't know her but she came up to me and she said that I'd been that I'd never be anything. I'd never make it. I never go to college. I never graduate and and that it was nothing but I never succeed in life because of who I was. And that was kind of like the first time I ever experienced that come outside of like me, going out into the world and actually trying to get a job. And like you know, trying to make my life a a better play, a better like have a better future. So it's kind of been like. Implanted in my brain from really lucky young age. That like because of my skin color and because of my what back that accent and like. The way I dressed and the way I acted like it was, it wasn't. OK, to be like that and be seen like that here in the. US so.
I: I see thank you for sharing that I'm I'm going to ask you a little bit now. I'm still in the same kind of about migration, UM? I know you have DACA. I'm wondering if you've ever visited again your home country.
P: No, I have it.
I: Uhm, do you feel any sense of attachment to your home country?
P: I do. I feel like it's like. It's like one of those type of attachments where, like you know, I guess like because people would tell me so much that I wasn't from here and I didn't belong here. I had that like like always like oh where am I from then and my parents are from Mexico so I was like that's where I'm from. My family all my family is from Mexico so uhm I I grew to love it even though. I never really lived there because I was three when I moved or I, you know, I crossed the border so it it was like. I love that group from far away.
I: I see, would you say that you're more attached to your home country or to the United States?
P: I think it's a mix of both because, uhm. When I was younger, that's that's what I wanted. I wanted I wanted to belong somewhere. I wanted to call some place home, and when we'd have these like in class like. Like story times or like oh tell us about yourself and like where you're from, who are you and all this stuff like I I didn't feel like I was from here yet so I I would always draw my love from mahiko and try to make those connections between my life here and my life that I could have had. There and and now it's like I. I'm not saying that give me that yeah like it, I'm from both places. They're both my homes and I think the only reason why I haven't left the US to go visit my family is one I can't. If I leave, I can't come back and that terrified me because I don't wanna leave. My home here, but I also don't wanna never be able to go back to my heat goal.
I: You see that. I, I mean you, you mentioned a little bit about your family and in Mexico, but how do you feel about maintaining relationships with family that you don't see really ever?
P: It's sad it's very hard. Uhm, because from the little Pueblo that I'm from from we don't have. We're very poor back there, so it's very hard to, you know. Now we have technology and you can FaceTime people from the surface is terrible, so there is no way we could do that. Uhm, if we ever do FaceTime them, it's like for five minutes and that's it because the connection never lasts longer than that. But also it's kind of hard because. It took me so long to call them because I I felt like they they might have been mad at me because I didn't stayed with them and it took me a while to like. Be like, no, they're not mad at me. I'm just I'm just trying to protect myself from what could happen of them being mad at me, but. It yeah the the connection like making like having conversations with them, having that like family connection is definitely hard to have when all you have is like sending each other like we I get letters in the mail from them. Sometimes on my birthday or holidays. I don't know it's. It's a it's hard to communicate sometimes because of our language difference. Like I get very nervous speaking in Spanish because. It's not, how can you say it's not like proper Spanish and the Spanish I learned is kind of mixed. It's like between like Spanish learned in my house and Spanish learned at school so. So it's like. The the communication like sometimes they just don't understand me when I'm trying to talk to them.
I: Yeah, I see that. Yeah, so I mean in talking about language.I mean you were pretty young when you migrated how? Was it like? I don't know what like the main language at home is, but how was it like navigating learning English and like maintaining your Spanish?
P: It was I could. When I started going to kindergarten, of course. That's when, like I started hearing everybody else speak English and it kind of being like you have to learn.You have to. You have to come. And I tried my best. Yes, but. I it was very hard. It was very very hard because again like in my first few years here. UM, the only Spanish I ever learned to like, read, write, speak was at home. So it's very like like I don't wanna like make it sound like it's less, but it's kind of like half asked because we didn't have the proper teachings for it. It was just at home with my parents. Just having conversations with them, you know, and that's how I learned by having conversations with my parents and then teaching us like, oh, this means this. And this means that. And it wasn't. And they didn't have. Uhm, much of an education back in Mexico so it was hard for them as well to teach us something that they had to learn by themselves in in the terms of like writing and reading and then going into school. My primary language was Spanish at the time, so it it was very hard for me to understand other people and I wouldn't ask for help because I was too shy and I didn't want to seem like I I was weaker than anybody else, or I couldn't do something. Uhm, so I fell behind a lot because I wouldn't ask for the help. I had this like kind of like shame. Kind of feeling that I I shouldn't ask for help.
I: I see and and is now. I mean with a lot of like 1.5 generation or just like youth that got here really young. Is that something you struggle with? Like? Uhm, maybe now?Yes yeah. Like navigating both languages.
P: It it it's it's this. It's like. I don't think I've I. I didn't start noticing it till like lately, because like I, I have conversations with my friend about it, but it's like in my head. Sometimes I'll think I'll think about something in Spanish in my head, but then I'll say it in English or I'll think it in English. But I'll say it in Spanish and then when I'm. Writing, it's like it, I can't, it's so hard. I it's so frustrating because I know that like I know how to write in English. I know how to write in Spanish. But when I when it comes to like actually putting the pen to the paper and and like writing those words out, my both my language is kind of like have this like fighting war inside my head where like I'll like write it like half English half Spanish.
I: I see. OK yeah, thank you for that. I get that struggle I I didn't hear it so so now we're going to talk a little bit about belonging and how that comes to play. Living in Santa Cruz County. So we found that belonging is a pretty broad term and it means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.What would you? Say belonging means to you.
P: Belonging for me. I think it's like. I know I'm never gonna like belong to like the whole US you know what I mean but I know that belonging for me is kind of like belonging to the people around me like having that that circle of people that I can trust in and it's like I belong in this area because of them, you know. They they keep me strong. And it remind me that like just because I'm not being on just because I have dark skin doesn't mean. It doesn't mean anything. It doesn't change who I am, it just means that that's who I am like. I don't, I don't know. I'm not explain it like you know. This is yeah.
I: So when you mentioned like that, you're never gonna belong to elaborate a little bit, only you mean by that.
P: Yeah, uhm. Lately it's been. I before I didn't I I didn't like looking at the news or like getting myself into like why people say like all these hate speeches about like certain races and all this stuff. But because of what's been going on and because it's being published. By so much by social media, not the news. I kind of like. I've seen it more where like. I've seen it more often where I see like like people like calling out or trying to show intimidate people from other races who are like immigrants to this country. Uhm and. It makes me feel like there's so many people out there who don't want. Me here, not me, as in like me me but like me as in like my culture, my my people, my people that look like me or people who don't look like them and I kind of identify with those people. And it's it's heartbreaking because I I've been calling this place home for so long. That it's like I don't know like. I belong here, but then sometimes I feel like I don't and it's just like ongoing. Like yes and no in my head.
I: Thank you so. I mean, you mentioned it kind of in a general sense, but now like. Where do you feel like you belong?
P: I think. Living here, I've kind of made memory in Santa Cruz. I've made memories in so many places that I've I've I consider myself saying that like this is my home. Like if I leave and I go to Mexico it's going to be very. Be hard because one I know I can't come back if I do leave UM and two because I have no real like. Memories that I can like actually think of from being in Mexico and all the real memories that I have are from here like living in Santa Cruz like from like parties, birthday birthdays from going to the park with some friends from hanging out at the beach. Each come from school you know, like. Yeah, this is the place where I. Made all my memories. My life was built here.
I: Now I see thank you. Is there any places so you can have like a lot of feelings towards Santa Cruz and your life? Santa Cruz? Is there any places like that? Maybe don't foster a sense of belonging here in Santa Cruz County.
P: I know I mean. I didn't used to think like that. I was kind of very naive when I was little, like when I was like I was like oh, everybody is equal like they might have a little bit more money, but that's OK because. We're all the same. But growing up, it kind of like became more surreal that, like, no, we're not all the same. Uhm, some people have more opportunities than others and. I guess over time I've had this like. I've had this like not hate kind of feeling, but like this weird like I don't belong in this area kind of sensation when I go up to like where the big houses are, the ones that are like big with their white picket fence and everybody has like 3 cars and their bicycles. Motorcycles like they're they. They have good life. You know what I mean? Like not as in like like the lovelive but like in like they won't ever have to wonder where their next meal will come from. And I guess. That's the only place I'd feel kind of uncomfortable because. I don't want to think about it that way. It makes me sad that I even think about it in that in those terms.
I: Yeah, I see that. So more like a like how like the contrast and experiences is like, yeah?
P: Yeah, like like uhm. Like and like, I mean like when I go to stores like if there's like a, uh, the security guard is actually chasing me or like watching where I'm going instead of like that other like blonde girl who like is just walking around by herself and I'm with my parents. You know, like that. That makes me feel like I don't belong here.
I: Yeah, and I mean I'm assuming with that like statement that you may, it's it experiences like that have happened to you.
P: Oh yeah.
I: Do you? Do you have any like other? Specific examples of that?
P: Uhm, yeah, I think the one that like has always like. Uhm, stuck to me was one actually happened in Safeway. Uhm I had. This is 1 security guard. I don't think he works there anymore but. This one security guard. Uhm came up to me and my brother's girlfriend and was like hey, did you guys feel anything? Let me check your pockets and I we thought he was joking. We're like, Oh no like why would we like sure like here you go and he's like no, no, no, no, no. You have to open it and like he was getting very aggressive and that's when we like got. Scared because. Oh, it was just us two like like we were told that you know when when you're a girl it's. Like you have to be careful. You know 'cause you're a girl and you're quote UN quote weaker and stuff so it it it terrified me because I didn't know what to do. I was like scared. I was just like I why would you think that I stole something like I have no I don't have a. What are the hot pockets? My pants don't have pockets like where would I take something? And so it. It that was the first instant that, like that, has always stuck in my head was that that security guard being very like aggressive about like no, no like you stole something. I'm pretty sure you took something like you have something so.
I: And then, and it's kind of like where. Did that come from right like?
P: Yeah, it's like and that my day was going so good that day I went to the store. We're like, OK, let's get some food and we're gonna go snack. We're gonna go. To the beach and then that guy just comes up to me and he it. That day was ruined. I went home and I cried because I don't know that that experience. Kind of like. Broke me 'cause before that. I don't think it has ever happened to me out of school. You know, like in school I get it work, all kids and some kids can be. A little meaner than others. But this was like an authority figure I guess. Like somebody that you would a child would be sent to to ask for help.
I: Yeah, and how old were you when this instance occurred?
P: Uhm, I think at the time I was around like. 1315 years old.
I: Oh sure. Yeah, did this like experience influence how like maybe? I don't know how to word this, did they this experience like influence? Maybe you avoiding Safeway, or like how you come.
P: And the I mean I don't. I try not to like. Think it as in for like like this, this one like security guard did this to me. All security guards are bad. I just think as in like whenever I saw that security guard, I would say clear I wouldn't look at him, I wouldn't. I would try my best to not look like I had my hands in my pocket or I was grabbing something and then putting in my pocket like. I would make sure that if I grabbed something I would put it back with both my hands and I would like kind of like put my hands to the like like in front of me and be like OK I'm backing away like sliding my hands like. I don't have it anymore like I put it down. But then after that I was kinda like no, I can't keep doing this, but I I did stop kind of like like uhm making it like super obvious that I didn't have something in my hands. But it did. It did kind of like hurt me for a while and I would do that. But then I stopped seeing the security guard there and and and then everybody. I started my my. My friend started working at the Safeway and she got to me some coworkers there and she introduced me to some. People and them. And then I I would go in and I would say hi to those people that I would, I would I would recognize and I that I've met before, and I felt a little safer. I felt like they know me. They know that I'm not capable of doing it. Things like that so. Like they will stand up for me.
I: Yeah, I see that. Thank you. Uhm, can you? So that was a little bit like a not belonging, can you? Can you think of an experience where you felt like you were really part of your community or you felt like you really belonged?
P: Yeah, uhm, I mean right now. Most recent that I have is probably this like activism group that I that come among my friends. Some has like helped to create UM and a bunch of our friends have joined and it's it's like all love. They are here to help the community, and yesterday we had like a little meeting and we had a discussion about what had happened to the Falafel place downtown. The actually the guy from there pushed one of the ladies from a UM. From her hot dog stand and like tossed all her food, somebody had gone and vandalized his building. And yes, we all thought that it was like wow, he deserves it. But at the same time, it's like, no, it's not OK. Like if we're standing up for people who are suffering right now, like. And we don't want people to hurt them. Why would we want it the other way around? Why would we want to hurt other people like we're here to help everybody like regardless your skin color, your business like anything, regardless of your like choice and like I, I vote for Trump, I vote for. Obama, I vote for Bernie. I will you know, I mean like regardless, whatever you think wherever you wanna go in life like we just want to support everybody. We just want to help and that has really brought a lot of joy into my life because I don't think I've ever found a place like that where there's like there's no hate. You know, it's all just volunteers trying to show up. For our community and like give love. And that's the most I felt connected with my community.
I: Nice, uhm. How did you come to like be part? Of that group.
P: Yeah so. Uh, Pauline is in the back of this conversation and Ballina once and I we had a conversation of how we like when, uh, the George Floyd started breaking out. Like all the news and media started like going off on it. We saw the pain that our community was in and we saw that there was a lot of people who who wanted to do something but didn't know where to go. Like us like we wanted to do something but we didn't know where to go. We didn't want to get ourselves in trouble, but we also didn't want to stay doing nothing. So we created a group chat. Where people could go and like be like hey there is this March going on there is this meeting going on? There's this donation place you can donate to this this information you can educate yourself on if you have any questions, ask them. I'm here and we'll try to answer. Them the best. We can and. And that's how it started. And then another. Some people from that group were like hey like we want to get hands on like we wanted to be in the front lines we wanna we wanna be here physically for our community go out there in March and that's how the second group started.
I: Well, that's really cool.
P: Yeah, thank you.
I: Uhm, so we've now that we're talking a little bit more about community. Would you say that you trust your community?
P: Yes I do. At least the the community I surround myself with because, uh, I mean we all choose the people we surround ourselves with, right? So there's people that I choose not to have conversations with because I know that they'll get too aggressive and there's people that I know that have around the same. Like they want to change our community like show that we even though we're kids, we're here to support. And even though we don't have a stable job, yeah, you know what I mean? We haven't graduated yet. We are still here for our communities no matter what, and I think because I've surrounded myself with people like that, I feel like I belong. And I feel like I have a a place to really like fall and know that somebody will be there to pick me up.
I: Yeah, that's really cool, uhm? How can I continue this I? I guess I'm going to shift a little bit. And talk. A little bit of. Like your childhood and growing up here in Santa Cruz, just first and foremost, did you like growing up in Santa Cruz?
P: Uhm, it was a. Mix I think I I I liked Santa Cruz. But I didn't like the people much.
I: Can can you elaborate a little bit on that?
P: Yeah, uhm. I mean, uhm. Being here in Santa Cruz, I mean like being I. I remember the first time I came. One of like my first first memories is of me, my family taking us to the beach and living where we live. And we were we. We ate a lot of fish. But we never saw the ocean. Uhm, we only heard stories about like how it looked, how it smelled like the feeling of actually being there and actually being capable to like see it for the first time. It like made me cry and because? I don't know. I had this like feeling inside that like I belong here like even though I'm not technically from Santa Cruz like I was meant to be here. So I think I've always had this connection with Santa Cruz come. From deep down in my heart. But sometimes the people in Santa Cruz primarily. Unfortunately, the white people would make me feel like I wasn't supposed to be here, like there was enough of them to kick me out. And kind of like shush me out.
I: Yeah, I mean OK, I'm not going off that. I mean Santa Cruz. I think just by at least Santa Cruz City, despite it, despite the county having maybe like a large like Latinx population. I think it's. Some very like white dominant. How does that like come into play? Like is there spaces where you? I mean, you've mentioned like your activism group and stuff, but like how does that play for it? Being like a very white dominant city?
P: I think it's because. I guess I learned this not so long ago where it's like people don't tell their stories enough one because they don't feel comfortable, and that's OK too, because they're scared and three because they don't really know how to express it. They haven't had the opportunity to tell their stories of of like immigration. Of like travel coming here like immigrating here of their experiences here. And there hasn't been enough voices for younger kids to hear, like, hey, like, I'm just like you like there was nobody I could relate to, I guess. And that's why it was kind of tough because I was looking for that. I was looking like OK. Who can I relate to? Who can I be like? You have kind of the same problems as me like. Can you give me some of your wisdom and and there wasn't much of that because? Everybody that I knew was so new to here, so they were going kind of through the same thing, so there's nobody I could actually go to for help. And then then there was like quite wider side. It was handing Cruise where it was like they would look me up and down like I was gross I was dirty when I would speak it be like what are you saying like that? Sounds weird uhm? But yeah, that's I guess that's how kind of I see it. It is primarily like Latino, like the community, but I don't think enough of us have spoken up. And but like this is my story and and that's why younger kids have harder time connecting with their community because. They only see one side of it.
I:
Yeah, let me.
I:
When is like, can you recall when was like the first time you saw?
I:
Maybe someone that you could identify with or like met someone or like just someone you can identify with.
P:
I don't.
P:
Only recently I found somebody I could really relate to and I think it's only because they were strong enough to actually tell me their story and that's why I'm kind of like emotional 'cause it's like it's a very.
P:
It's a very personal story and that's why I understand people not wanting to tell their stories, because also the fear of like the hate, the hate that comes with it.
P:
Sometimes when you speak up.
P:
But yeah, that's I met this one person who just like opened up to me and told me their story and kind of like allowed me to tell my own story.
P:
Uhm, but growing up when I was little, I think I think the only real friends I had were the teachers.
P:
Oh yeah, and I would connect with them because they were so caring.
P:
They're just like I'm here for you.
P:
Like if you need anything like I'd have.
P:
I don't know if you know this place called CK.
P:
It's for kids like a daycare.
I:
OK.
P:
And I and I had like at least three or four teachers there who were so nice and so sweet to me that they would let me like, go into the cupboards and do my own art thing.
P:
And that's what I kind of like.
P:
Like come surrounded myself with to like like give myself love was like art you know and they allowed me to do that.
P:
Some teachers would Take Me Out to the movies, Take Me Out on car rides because I didn't have that many friends and they saw it and they didn't wanna make me feel alone.
P:
So dumb.
P:
That's how I had my first like like kind of like, uhm, I guess.
P:
I felt like they understood me because they cared.
P:
For me and for my family, regardless of my skin color and my the way I spoke and my weird way of like being me.
P:
I don't know like in my culture you know like they they loved my culture in which was it made me feel happy?
I:
It's really nice.
I:
So overall, would you say that school?
I:
Was a place that you felt you belonged at.
P:
It wasn't school.
P:
It was the teachers like if I decided to go out and have lunch outside.
P:
It was probably not going to be a good day, which had to happen because, you know, teachers can't always stay in.
P:
Their classrooms and.
P:
They can't always have you eating in their classrooms.
P:
So it had to.
P:
I had to eat outside and those experiences were horrible because I'd have kids pulling my hair because it's too long or because it was too dark or.
P:
'cause it was too puffy and curly and Tingley or.
P:
Looking I had a unibrow so I get I get made fun of because of that and my skin color.
P:
I was I'm pretty light now 'cause I work indoors, but I used to be like it's really dark.
P:
My skin used to be so pretty and I'd get made fun of it and I hated it.
P:
I hated my skin.
P:
I would wear.
P:
Sweaters every day.
P:
When I was in UM.
P:
Elementary school and middle school and high school.
P:
Uh, because I wanted to lighten my skin.
P:
I don't wanna.
P:
I don't want people to see my dark skin and dumb.
P:
I think that was tough for me, but yeah, usually I would stay in classes and eat and eat with the teachers because they I felt like they understood me and they.
P:
Cared for me.
I:
Yeah, thank you uhm, so I mean still sticking to the topic of school.
I:
What did you?
I:
Umm, how do I say this?
I:
What do you believe the overall attitude towards?
I:
Like immigrants and undocumented people was at your schools?
I:
I mean, you've.
I:
Kind of mentioned it, yeah.
P:
I think the teachers worked like hands on with me.
P:
Kind of saw saw me kind of sad so they they were very uplifting and they tried their best to make me happy and give me the opportunities that other kids had come.
P:
Like for like.
P:
Homework if I need a little more time they would try their best to give me some time or they would tell me or come in after school and I'll help you come.
P:
But after a while I kind of saw like like that was in elementary school that I felt this support.
P:
The principal was amazing in elementary school.
P:
The teachers were amazing.
P:
They would help me out, but then middle school started and it was a whole different story because like I felt like I was kind of lost in between the sea of kids.
P:
And trying to find that new connection with new.
P:
Teachers was very difficult.
P:
Uhm, so I think that's where I started.
P:
Kind of like feeling alone even more alone because I didn't have many teachers to go to.
I:
Yeah, OK.
P:
And that was like the one connection that I had to like feeling like I belonged at school.
I:
Yeah, OK, and it was the same way in high school as well.
P:
Like, yeah it was.
P:
I mean in high school.
P:
I remember like when I was in middle school I would go to the high school on like when we would get out early because there was this or this little group there that was called barrio.
P:
Battistoni Dozar or LSU.
P:
And it was like a group founded by Latinos.
P:
Uhm, for not just all Latinos.
P:
But it represented like Latinos.
P:
But it was for everybody who ever wanted to join, could join.
P:
And it made me feel like I belong somewhere.
P:
Because nobody was like looking at me.
P:
Like who are you like?
P:
We don't want you here.
P:
Even though I was a middle schooler and they only let high schools go, high schoolers go up.
P:
They kind of like adopted.
P:
Into their group and.
P:
Instead of like going out into the streets and hanging out with like I guess friends, I would go into LSU when they were open and they were my.
P:
Like they were my like school family.
I:
So now I mean you mentioned you were a part time student right now, right?
I:
Yes, yes.
P:
Let's talk a little bit.
I:
About your experience at at your school right now.
I:
Uhm, how has?
I:
The college experience been for you and your family in.
I:
General like Google.
P:
Uhm yeah my my my parents have no connection with.
P:
The school like.
P:
They there's if there's translate translation to Spanish, there's very little of it, so uhm, or there's like very little information that I I have seen.
P:
But also when I go to school I kind of keep my head down and it's like I keep to myself or if I'm with friends I I just talked to them because.
P:
I don't know I I guess I'm scared to like really talk to anybody else and kind of like like be like oh hey I'm happy like like look at me like I don't want that attention on me it it's it's kind of like been implanted in me from a young age that like attention is not good for us.
P:
No, but it it is it I I like the school.
I:
OK.
P:
They provide a lot of a actual like help for me but I don't know as in like the terms of my parents being connected and like actually like.
P:
Let me ever.
P:
Have like had conversations about school.
P:
Not really.
I:
OK, and you mentioned that the school provides a lot of help for you.
I:
Can you elaborate a little bit on that?
P:
Like, uh, like classes.
P:
I guess that's the closest I can get like.
P:
Like I can go to a counselor and kind of give him an idea of like what what kind of classes I want where I want to.
P:
Go and they'll help me, but.
P:
I I understand it, I get I get, why why?
P:
It's kind of hard right to make those connections, especially like you know.
P:
UM, going from like having a super close family in high school, like with the LSU group to like Kabrio where it's like a huge campus and UM.
P:
It just it's scary for me.
P:
You know, going somewhere that is so foreign and kind of like trying to make a name for myself and like.
P:
Uhm, school has always been hard for me again because of like English and Spanish, English, Spanish being my second language and English being my I mean Spanish being my first language and English being my second language.
P:
It's always been kind of hard to like.
P:
I don't know, just like read write it's it's kind of hard sometimes to like you know those words kind of blend in together.
P:
Those those languages blend for me, so uhm, I kind of get out.
P:
I kind of fall behind sometimes and I feel like I don't belong but you know you gotta keep pushing.
I:
Yeah, would you say that you feel?
I:
I mean I asked us about like your schools growing up but would you say that kabrio like fosters uhm like what's the over overall attitude towards immigrants and undocumented people at kabrio?
I:
Do you think?
P:
I don't.
P:
I think they're they're there are enough.
P:
There's some like groups that are there specifically for like the Latino community and others that they need.
P:
Help uhm?
P:
But at the same time, again like it's like, it's always been taught to me to asking for help is is a sign of weakness.
P:
I know it's not and I know that it's a bad thing, but it's always just like kind of in the back of my head and I guess that's why I'm scared to ask for help.
P:
So I know that help is there.
P:
I know I can get help, but finding my words and finding the right time and opportunity to ask for help is hard for me.
I:
I see and I think before you, before you made a comment a little bit about.
I:
How you like?
I:
To keep your head down on campus and stuff.
I:
And you said, how come I don't remember the exact words, but like bringing attention to yourself after having taught like to not do, can you?
I:
Talk a little bit more about like.
I:
What you meant by that?
P:
Yeah, uhm, I mean.
P:
I wanna I wanna just I want I.
P:
Do want to say that like?
P:
When I am with my friends, when I do go.
P:
With friends, it makes me feel confident because I know that there's people there with me.
P:
Uhm, who know me?
P:
And like if anybody accuses me of anything, it's like, no, no, I didn't do anything.
P:
And then they could be like, Oh yeah, we know her like she hasn't done anything like.
P:
We would have been with her and.
P:
And I think it's just like that kind of fear.
P:
Like I, I guess anywhere I go, it's always there like.
P:
Don't don't.
P:
The Coke K that they tell me I know people understand, but it's like not.
P:
And that's kind of like what I live by because of who of my skin color and who I am and my ethnicity.
P:
It's I have to like kind of abide by that.
I:
Yeah, OK.
I:
Yeah, thank you for that.
I:
Yeah, yeah.
I:
So now we're just going to shift a little bit and talk about like mixed status families.
I:
So to start off I think, uhm, do you feel that you have?
I:
Or more opportunities than other mixed status families living elsewhere.
I:
So like, do you think you have the same opportunity you and your family have the same opportunities in Santa Cruz than other people in other cities?
P:
I don't, I don't know, uhm.
P:
I think.
P:
I think in some ways we make our own opportunities, like if we can't find somebody who that will be able to take a chance on us like the my dad friend who like stood up stood up for him and was like I, I vouched for this man like he's a hard working man then like.
P:
We kind of make our own.
P:
Businesses you know?
P:
Like like they look little man the the lady working down down by the boardwalk selling her hot dogs like.
P:
You know, we we're fighting culture so we don't give up that easy, but I I do know.
P:
That it's it's harder for some, because some of us have been like.
P:
We come to a foreign foreign place where rules are kind of different than where we're from, and so some of us have a harder time, kind of like differentiating between those rules.
P:
And those laws.
I:
Yeah, I see, UM.
P:
And I'm sorry, and I mean rules by like like. Also like societies rules. You know what I mean? Like in medical societies rules are completely different from the US.
I:
Oh yeah.
I:
Yeah yeah, I see that.
I:
Actually, can you elaborate a little bit on that?
I:
Time record yeah?
P:
So by all means, I'm not trying to like.
P:
Say that this whole mejico is now because of course it.
P:
It's been a couple of been while since I've been to Mexico, but I remember for my parents their stories.
P:
They would tell me is that my mom had to stop going to school.
P:
She I think she didn't even go to middle school because there was boys.
P:
And my grandmother didn't want.
P:
To be flirting around with any boys.
P:
So she had to stay home and take and also because she had to take care of all the kids.
P:
And then, like.
P:
She was she was in fifth grade like she.
P:
Was supposed to.
P:
Take care of all the kids like her cousins, her brothers and they had huge families, so they needed a woman.
P:
I guess you know to.
P:
Cook to clean.
P:
To take care and then my dad had.
P:
To stop going he didn't get.
P:
He didn't get to go to high school because.
P:
They needed more money to survive and feed the mouse, so he had to stop going to school to go to work.
P:
And boys couldn't talk to girls.
P:
And if you talked to uh, if a girl was talking to a boy then she was like a sweat.
P:
And if a boy was talking to a girl, you know.
P:
It's like it's just.
P:
All that come attached to it.
P:
And then here it's like kids have to go to school.
P:
You have to at least get your GPA, you know.
P:
And here it's more like yes, go to college go.
P:
But you need to go to college like they parents give, give their kids more of a like.
P:
We moved here for this so there are opportunities you you take them or you don't and we're here to support you so you can take them.
P:
But it's up to you.
P:
And in Mexico it's a little different.
P:
It's like.
P:
There's no opportunities for you like.
P:
Work you need to work, yeah?

OK.
I:
Thank you for that.
I:
I guess next time I I want to ask you about when you realized.
I:
Uhm, your status like is that some like when did you first realize the implications of maybe being undocumented here in this country?
P:
Yeah, uhm, I think it was that time that that girl told me.
P:
Uh, I think it was around like we're doing like these like, uh, renaissance no no not renaissance, UM.
P:
The the when they when.
P:
They had the gold Rush era I think.
P:
If that's what it was called back in school when they would do those like big events where kids would dress up and kind of like play the part.
P:
Uhm, I it was kind of put in my face that I was like, you're you're you're not you're not supposed to be wearing that.
P:
You're supposed to be wearing something like more raggedy and like torn up and.
P:
It kind of hurt me 'cause I was like we're playing a part like this is not real life.
P:
This is just the game, you know.
P:
Like yes, we're learning about history, but it doesn't mean I have to wear some certain clothes because of my ethnicity and and it was kind of like putting my face that I think 'cause uhm.
P:
I wasn't just seeing it online and like in pictures I was or in like TV.
P:
I was being.
P:
It was being told to me like to my face in front of me and when I was little.
P:
That was, that was the first time.
P:
'cause in TV I was like, oh, that is pretend that's like pretend like they're just actors.
P:
They're playing the part?
P:
Yeah, yeah.
I:
You think your status plays?
I:
A role in your sense of belonging.
P:
Uhm, yeah.
P:
I, I think it does because of the society that we live in.
P:
It's kind of like it's.
P:
It's like, uh.
P:
People have kind of like created their own little bubbles, uhm?
P:
And uhm, some people decide to not see a certain side of the world because they're comfortable in their little bubble.
P:
And when they see, I guess, like you know what I mean, like when predominantly white people who like have money and have a stable job and their kids are like.
P:
Like they have the their, their opportunities are set and done.
P:
You know their goals are already made from like birth like uhm.
P:
It's and they see me.
P:
It's kind of like.
P:
They're they're like wow she is because she doesn't want to, it's because she doesn't care and I've been told that before.
P:
It's like you don't care.
P:
You don't want to.
P:
If you wanted to, you could have done it, but it's like the opportunities aren't there because people like you like don't give them to me like you don't let me show you that I'm capable.
P:
Of doing something big.
P:
So yeah.
I:
OK, uhm.
I:
Yeah, thank you I I I see what you mean.
I:
I I guess what I wanna ask next is uh.
I:
I don't know if I should, so you know.
I:
Like you know.
I:
These are questions about mixed status families your family has mixed statuses.
I:
Uhm, how has your experience?
I:
How does your experience like compare and contrast to like the rest of your families like?
I:
I know you have like.
I:
Like schools and siblings, yeah.
I:
Like yeah, can you talk about that?
P:
Yeah, of course.
P:
So my older brother.
P:
He's like probably four or five four years older than me, three years older.
P:
Than me and.
P:
He actually had to take care of me back in Mexico because of course you know you.
P:
You have to work for what you eat.
P:
Over there every day is like if you want to eat, you have to go out and you know either sell that corn that milk or whatever you have to get food to feed your kids.
P:
So my mom would go out and eat.
P:
Go make money or find a way to make money or be in our farm and my brother would stay to take care of us.
P:
Just one of my older other older brothers to the yeah older than me and myself and.
P:
He had to go.
P:
Through a lot, a lot because.
P:
Oh again, so I forgot to mention that the reason why we moved wasn't just because like a better opportunity for education, but because I was sick and one of my older brothers was sick.
P:
I had, I think if I remember correctly I have.
P:
I had like an air bubble in my brain that would cause me to have seizures.
P:
And in some instances I would come kind of like stop breathing.
P:
And the bills and my older brother was sick too, but the bills were piling up and they were getting too expensive.
P:
So that's when my dad decided to move and work and then he was like, hey, there's we.
P:
I found a place I found a job you guys can come and we can have better health benefits because of my job.
P:
So, but my brother had to struggle a lot.
P:
Because my mom would leave me alone with him because she had to and I would have seizures and he was.
P:
Very young again.
P:
He's only three to four years older than me, so imagine like me being like three years old. Him probably being like 6-5 and like me having seizures in front of him.
P:
Was probably terrifying for him.
P:
Uh, and then my younger brother.
P:
He had to be like internal for a while because of his sickness, but he got we got better with time and we moved and I guess my older brother had to grow up really fast.
P:
And so did my other brother, because you know, they they felt very like they felt like they had to protect me.
P:
Also, like I was bullied a lot and I would tell them and they kind of like became my like bodyguards I guess to like protect me from like the people that wanted to like even funding me though who taught me or stuff like that.
P:
My younger brother and my little sister I.
P:
She's barely one, so she's so.
P:
I know, but damn it I guess.
P:
My younger brother is kind of.
P:
He doesn't see or understand the pain that we've gone through, but I know that he has his own individual pain with like situations that he has had to live through, because, again, of his skin color his his speech impediment when he was younger.
P:
So I think we've all had our our fair.
P:
Fair amount of like struggles, and they've all been different, even though because we we've all had like mixed status.
P:
You know, like he can go back and forth, my little brother, and he has.
P:
He has visited Mexico and come.
P:
It some people would tell me like oh, aren't you jealous that he's going to Mexico and it's yes, I'm there's a certain amount of jealousy going on, but like at the same time I'm happy because even though I can't he can and with me giving him a hug.
P:
That means that he can give my uncles my aunts my cousins, my grandma.
P:
My grandpa hugs for me.
P:
Uhm, the notes I I can send notes with him.
P:
I you know it's.
P:
I think it's like they we'll have like different experiences, but they are all kind of the same and.
P:
They all kind of understand each other in a way.
I:
Now thank you for that.
I:
But I I like that that's a really nice sentiment about being able to like, hug your brother and him passing on that hug.
I:
Uhm so yeah uhm.
I:
I guess, and finishing up the mixed status topic, how has being part of a mixed status family influenced any of the decisions you made in life?
P:
I guess the most like prominent one would be just like me having to be careful because I'm I'm mixed.
P:
That is, you know, like my little brother he's like.
P:
With the whole like come.
P:
Black lives movement.
P:
He's like I want to be in the front lines.
P:
I want to and I can and I will and I get it and understand it.
P:
But it's like a target on his back is a target on our backs.
P:
Even though he is a citizen.
P:
Uhm, he could get like arrested for whatever reason that the cops won't arrest him.
P:
And then they'll have eyes on him.
P:
And then they'll.
P:
Find out that I'm.
P:
I don't have papers, and then they'll find out that my parents don't have papers and then so on and so on.
P:
And you know, it's it's scary living in a place where, like you, know that.
P:
I mean, the law is supposed to, like, you know, uphold like the right, and like help, people who are in need but at the same time there's some people within the law that have other agendas and they can get away with it.
I:
Uhm yeah, OK for that.
I:
And I guess talking a little since we're.
I:
Talking about like law.
I:
And policy and whatnot.
I:
I'm gonna shift to that, be the focus and.
I:
We talked to.
I:
Did it before.
I:
Uhm, but let's elaborate on it, uhm?
I:
So how much do you pay attention to your fault?
P:
Wait, what was that again?
I:
Sorry, how much do you pay attention to or follow current politics?
P:
Uhm, I think I don't know the nitty gritty like details, but I have a like I tried to inform myself as much as I can, but at the same time.
P:
Right now it's kind of hard to distinguish who to trust and who not to, because like usually you.
P:
Go to the.
P:
News to like educate yourself.
P:
Sometimes you know that those who like don't have the the the like actual where and where to actually go.
P:
News is the closest that we have and.
P:
And media has kind of been like seen as in like.
P:
Not telling the truth and kind of like putting their own opinions into it instead of just giving us the details.
P:
As in like I, I'm pulling myself as much as I can on like vodka the drink and because like again I'm like a recipient.
P:
So I try, but at the same time it's hard to inform yourself on something that like.
P:
It was almost taken away and I don't.
P:
I don't like putting myself in like sad situations because it gets to me.
P:
I don't like being sad.
P:
I either I, I'm either happy or I'm super sad.
P:
There's like no in between for me, so I I try to like only look at the positive so I guess it's it's kind of like hard for me to really be informed.
P:
Like completely all the time.
P:
Because of that, I I I I tried to only see the happy side of like the information that's.
P:
Being given to us.
I:
Uhm, OK, so that's a little bit more about like the whole like the country's policies. Do you keep uhm?
I:
How can I word this?
I:
Have you ever?
I:
I don't know if you keep up with it, but have you ever felt disappointed or proud in how your city handled immigration proposals or policies?
P:
I think to a certain extent I've been like proud of my my city.
P:
Like Santa Cruz.
P:
I don't know if you remember when the ice.
P:
Uhm, like.
P:
Ice was in fact, when ICE was in Santa Cruz.
P:
My high school that I was in the teachers, especially the Latino teachers and those who stood for the Latino community and the people who were immigrants.
P:
They they they came to me and they came to other students like telling us like hey, like I I don't know if you know this and but I want you to know that you're safe here like we're not letting anybody come into the school to take you like stuff like that.
P:
You know.
P:
I mean, like I've been, I guess, proud of like.
P:
Again, like people, I surround myself like those like positive people who I know that will.
P:
Stand up for me.
P:
Uhm, because I'm like I guess I guess I'm always looking for that.
P:
That's that's what I'm looking for.
P:
People who I know can like.
P:
Believe in me, stand up for me and like all that stuff and like let's say like like the the sheriff's the tasks.
P:
Uhm, how they said that Santa Cruz was a.
P:
A sanctuary for like immigrants, and that they wouldn't be giving or helping ICE, but they they also couldn't stop them.
P:
You know, like there's.

There's only so much.
P:
That certain people can do or are willing to do, and I guess I'm proud of.
P:
I guess the police for.
P:
Not just like giving everything up and being like here you go take this like go and.
P:
Do what you do.
P:
Uhm, but also like I've only recently started to educate myself because.
P:
Uh, being when I was smaller I was kind of like I can't bow.
P:
I can't.
P:
I don't have no say in anything why would I put myself in like?
P:
In, why would I read all those hateful things or bad things that are happening, like when I can't do anything about it?
P:
It's only gonna make me sad.
P:
So yeah.
I:
OK, so.
I:
I guess.
I:
You know there's a lot of rhetoric like negative rhetoric about immigrants on the news, and like in general and like policies.
I:
Like restrictive immigration policies being passed up.
I:
How does it feel like like being surrounded or seeing these things being said?
P:
It makes me mad because I get like.
P:
What can I do like at least?
P:
Now now there is a place that I can go to and like if my opinion my like raw like opinion and be like hey like I feel like this I wish we could do something about it.
P:
Do you guys have any like the the little group that we can form?
P:
Like I can go to them and since some of them are.
P:
And some of them do have like.
P:
The ability to vote.
P:
The ability to to go somewhere and have that conversation with somebody that I'm probably too scared to, because, again, like I might, something might happen to me.
P:
A target on my back, so it's like it's it having having a place to go to to give my opinion and.
P:
Feel safe because I'm giving my opinion.
P:
Is, uh, right now, like the only the only place I'm going to and kind of like where I.
P:
Give my that's why I'm like informing myself way more now than I was when I was smaller because I have a place to go to to like actually try to.
P:
Make a difference.
I:
Yeah, OK, cool.
I:
So now I'm going to shift a little bit and talk about like resources.
I:
Has there ever?
I:
Let me find.
I:
The word has.
I:
Has there ever been a time when your family has reached out to like any resources?
I:
When you guys were going through through difficult times.
I:
Yeah, broad term so I can include anything that you think would fit as a resource.
I:
Just any sort sort of support.
P:
Yeah, uhm.
P:
I think the the the ones like they've they've been a part of my life like.
P:
Basically since I've been here like if I go there I know everybody will know my name so it's a they're called Team Center.
P:
It's the Davenport team center.
P:
And they they have like probably surrounded us with so much love and so much help.
P:
They do like food banks.
P:
They come for like.
P:
Holidays for like Mexican holidays they they have them too, so it's a place where we can go to not just only feel like we're getting the help, but also feel like there's a part of home there.
P:
Uhm, they like they do this really amazing thing during Christmas where they give presents to the kids because they understand that sometimes parents don't have the money to buy gifts and I think and then they they also do like.
P:
They they had they used to have this like my life locodoco group that was free.
P:
It was free and everybody donated to buy the uniform.
P:
The dresses the finalize the the, the clothes and the teachers who are teaching the dance.
P:
They they they they taught it.
P:
For free, like it was all volunteer work for the kids, which kind of like gave me like a little bit of hope here.
P:
So yeah, they they probably have been the biggest group who has like.
P:
Given my family like that like little plate, the little little bit of home.
P:
The other one would probably be.
P:
LSU in in where I used to go to high school in Santa Cruz.
P:
High, uh?
P:
That place since day one that I've been there has only been filled with like come in, come in, come in, eat.
P:
Here's food you don't have money here you go.
P:
Here's here's the so probably one that we have in the back, like, uhm, do you need to?
P:
You need to sleep.
P:
Are you super tired?
P:
Like if somebody like super tired?
P:
And can't go to class because they had a horrible night that day.
P:
They'll give them like a one day pass or one like class pass to just take a nap and feel like they don't have to explain why they feel bad.
P:
They don't have to call anybody to like give consent, they just they can just stay there, feel safe and just take a quick nap like.
P:
That place was amazing, it it was another like little piece of home in school, uhm.
P:
Let's see.
P:
Food what?
P:
Food, what up at UCSC.
P:
Uhm, I used to be like very shy.
P:
And and I would dread the having to talk in front of like big groups, and I had never told my story out loud before.
P:
And there's this one guy.
P:
His name was Jerome he he gave me.
P:
Actually, not just around everybody, they gave me the like strength.
P:
They were like empowering me with their words, just like you can do it like I've seen your hard work in the fields.
P:
Like if you can work that hard, you can go up there and just like tell your story like if you don't want to, you can come down and all this like like just like.
P:
Like I don't know like this love given to me that like juicy points like like.
P:
Like they're there to support me and I was capable.
P:
I was able to.
P:
Of course I was crying the whole time, so I'm pretty sure nobody understood what I was saying, but uhm, I had this little like 5 minute speech about who I am and where I come from and.
P:
Kind of like why I'm here and where I wanna go.
P:
Uhm, at their banquet and at the end the the amount of love that I got from the spectators from the people there.
P:
Uhm was huge, not only from just them but like the crew.
P:
The people I worked with the the cooks cooking the food, the people driving the like, people like the valet like peopleclick like everybody there was so loving and supportive and.
P:
They they taught me how to be a leader, how not to be afraid to be a leader.
P:
And all that stuff.
P:
So yeah, those three places have been amazing.
I:
It's not nice.
I:
Is is there any resources that you would want to see expanded in your community?
P:
I think.
P:
I don't know my.
P:
I think those three places they're like.
P:
They caught me at the right time.
P:
Uhm, so if more kids could be like exposed to that much love and like acceptance at a young age.
P:
The better they'll do in their future, because if if I was told at a very young age that I wouldn't be able to do it.
P:
Uh, make it in life, but those three places completely like you raised all that.
P:
We're like no, no, no.
P:
That's one person.
P:
Look at all this like where a lot of people backing.
P:
You up and.
P:
If I think it's like kids had more of that, you know that that support that unconditional support.
P:
I think like.
P:
Everybody can make it a life as long as they have that like that, like cecep with a attitude from everybody around them.
P:
Instead of getting that like you can't do it because of you because of who you are.
P:
Or your ethnicity like that's?
P:
I think that's what we need.
I:
OK, thank you uhm.
I:
So now we're going to talk a little bit about thriving.
I:
Someone who's thriving looks like.
P:
What does thriving look like?
P:
For me, uhm.
P:
It's not about money.
P:
I think it's about doing something that you love.
P:
Regardless of what anybody says.
P:
Like I don't know like.
P:
Uhm, I guess.
P:
I've been told a lot that like being a teacher doesn't make too much money.
P:
And but I love I.
P:
Would love to work with kids so it's like.
P:
I don't care how much money I make, as long as I like, help somebody else.
I:
You know?
P:
And I think that's striking for me, because like I don't know like.
P:
I wanna I like if if you wanna like at the other line you need a job right?
P:
You need a job to like kind.
P:
Of pay the.
P:
Bills, but if you have a job that you don't call a job that makes you happy everyday, that makes you feel like I'm awake today like I'm ready to go into work, not like, oh, I do I have enough.
P:
Big pay to like call in today.
P:
I think they'd be thriving for me.
I:
OK, thank you.
I:
Uhm, what do you think?
I:
Are the conditions needed to create spaces where immigrants can thrive?
P:
I think.
P:
Uhm, like maybe having, uh, places where like people can go to and like give their opinions or concerns or comments.
P:
Without feeling judged or without feeling like, do you have enough evidence to back your your whatever up like if we had a place where people can go ask for help without being interrogated, or give their opinion without feeling like it's invalid?
P:
I think that's what would be mostly necessary in this place, 'cause there's people who are willing to give people in need food.
P:
People like donations like there's people who are willing to do that, but there's not enough people willing to like accept other people's voices for what they are.
P:
Just just accepting their their comments, concerns like without being like so, did you have enough information like like all this other like questionnaires that aren't?
P:
Super unnecessary when somebody.
P:
Need help?
I:
OK, so do you so that that that's something that you think kind of stops people and like expressing their concerns or accessing resources.
I:
The fact.
I:
That they're part.
P:
Being questioned?
P:
Like Are you sure like?
P:
Do you really need it?
P:
Or like all this other stuff like?
P:
I also like the fear of like asking the right people questions because as a as a me not having papers I have to be very.
P:
I have to be very careful with who I ask or who I tell.
P:
Anything because it can backfire on me and.
P:
Then like they can use my me not having papers as a like.
P:
As a weapon against me.
P:
And I think a lot of people have that fear.
P:
Of like who can I trust with this information?
I:
OK.
P:
And yeah, some people have children and there's that extra fear.
I:
OK, so so kind of to like so just asking for help and not being questioned because there is that fear of.
I:
Thank you so.
I:
So now we're pretty much going to wrap up.
I:
So I guess one of my few last questions is going to be like what kind of advice would you give to someone who comes from the same background as yourself.
P:
It's gonna be so corny, but haters are gonna.
P:
Hate you know.
P:
Like just keep pushing like you.
P:
You came here for a reason you came here to better yourself, your family, your you know like.
P:
Keep pushing, don't give up like there's going to be so many people wanting you to give up and using everything they can against you and deflecting all their trauma on you.
P:
But don't give up like.
P:
You you got here, that's one step you gotta keep pushing like.
P:
I don't know like yeah he's gonna hate.
I:
Thank you, can you share what your ideal future would look like in regards to immigration and mixed status family?
P:
I think, uhm?
P:
If we can't get that.
P:
Like easier opportunity to get papers because there's a lot of people saying like like, oh why didn't you come the legal way?
P:
Like you could have gone the legal, it's it's so much harder than what people think it.
P:
Is if we can't fix that, you know to make it a little more easier on people, especially 'cause it's expensive ahead.
P:
Is hacking that's so much majority of the people coming here is because of money they need to survive.
P:
Uhm, I think it'd be like having like society, not disregard.
P:
Those that are different like from them, like Latinos, like any immigrant, like as long as we are accepted as humans.
P:
By all means, like you know, yeah.
I:
Uhm, cool, uhm, last question.
I:
If there's anything else that you would wanna add to anything that you've talked about today.
P:
Uhm, no, not that I can think of.
I:
OK, cool then on my part.
I:
Uhm, that's it that I have for the end.
